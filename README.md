Search for recipes based on specified ingredients.
Automatically calculate and display recipe difficulty.
Technical Requirements
Python 3.6+ installed locally.
Ability to handle user-friendly error messages for common input errors.
Interaction with locally hosted MySQL databases (to be implemented in later exercises).
Well-structured and documented code with meaningful comments.
